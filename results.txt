You are a contestant on Let's Make A Deal. In this game, there are three doors. Behind one
door is a brand new Corvette; there are goats behind the other two doors. Monty Hall asks you to select
a door; after you have chosen one, he opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat behind it. You
can now choose to stick with your original choice, or to switch to the remaining door.

-Run a thousand trials of this experiment. Can you explain the results?
	With three doors: 
		Wins when sticking: 345
		Wins when switching: 655
-Bonky Hall, Montyâ€™s brother, starts his own game show in which there are four doors instead of
three, but with the same setup otherwise. When you choose a door initially, Bonky also opens
one door, revealing a goat behind it. In addition to your chosen door, there now remain two more
closed doors. Should you switch to one of these? Why?
	With four doors: 
		Wins when sticking: 250
		Wins when switching:376
	Explanation: If you do switch, your chances increase from 1/4 to 3/8.
